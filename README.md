IconIDFinder is a GUI tool to find ID of a League of Legends summoner icon by searching for a name.

# Binary version

# How to use it
1. Start the program:
* Open `main.py` or `ID Finder.exe`

2. Search for your icon
![search](readme/searching.gif)
* Input your query
* Press Enter / Search Button

3. Wait for the program to fetch all icons. This can take a long time, depending on your query. To minimize it, try to be as specific as possible with your search term.
